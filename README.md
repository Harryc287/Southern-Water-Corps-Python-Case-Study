This case study is composed of two parts

Part I: Descriptive Statistics
•	Demonstrates a mastery of the Pandas and Matplotlib libraries.  
•	Showcases creations of box plots, line charts, filtering anomalous values using 1.5x IQR Method, use for loops to iterate data through a data frame series and understanding how to apply secondary axes to create combo charts.

Step 1: Import Libraries

Step 2: Descriptive Statistics

Step 3: Create a Boxplot

Step 4: Filtered DataFrames with Box Plots

Step 5: Create Quartiles

Step 6: Identify Outliers

Step 7: Create a box plot without outliers

Step 8: Plot and Examine Each Column

Step 9: Create a Plot for Pump Failures Over a Rolling Time Period

Part II: Inferential Statistical Analysis
•	Creation of Pearson Correlation Heatmaps
•	Conducting regression analysis in Python using statsmodels.api library
•	Plotting regressive model on secondary axes

Step 10: Create a Heatmap

Step 11: Create a Barplot of Correlated Features

Step 12: Create a Rolling Standard Deviation Heatmap

Step 13: Use OLS Regression

Step 14: Analysis of Coefficients

Step 15: Validate Predictions
